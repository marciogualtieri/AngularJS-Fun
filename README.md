### <a name="on-the-design-choices"></a> ON THE DESIGN CHOICES

The only purpose of this project is to teach myself JavaScript and UI development.
The following frameworks and tools are being used:

* [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/): Single Page Web Application Framework.
* [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/): For automated tests using BDD.
* [Karma Plugin](https://github.com/craigburke/karma-gradle): For running automated tests from Gradle.

I'm following the book [Unraveling AngularJS 1.4](http://www.amazon.com/Unraveling-AngularJS-With-Complete-Samples-ebook/dp/B00ULTPP00).
For my own reference, the book's examples are located [here](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21AOrZVkcC_sB8S-Q&id=79DA757D3D2B5BAA%21207784&cid=79DA757D3D2B5BAA).
